Java-Chat-Application
=====================

This is a simple client server chat app. 

This is a netbeans project.

For this application to work, the server must be run first, the server does not have a GUI. 

Then you can run as many clients as you like, that will communicate with each other.

At the minute the current version of the application only works on the same computer. 
It cannot currently find the IP address of different computers, 
only works using "localhost" i.e the same computer.
